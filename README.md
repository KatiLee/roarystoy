## Lab 43 & 44 React Native and Expo Go
### Problem Domain
We are going to create a phone app that utilizes capabilities.  
- Use at least 1 native device feature (Contacts, Camera, GPS, etc)
- High Fidelity Styling and UX
- Properly Documented for End Users
- Use 2 screens / components
- Use and share state between components/screens

### Lab 43
- Deliver your MVP for raw functionality
- Your dev environment should be properly working
- Other users should be able to scan your QR and see your app on any device
- All of your core “features” should be working properly
- Un-Styled is fine. We’re looking for things to buzz, light up, detect movement, etc.

### Lab 44
- Quality and Thoughtful Styling using css-in-js
- Right sized tap targets, good contrast
- Dark and Light Modes
- Well thought through UX
- Be considerate of individuals that primarily use their thumbs, left or right hands

### Setup
- Initialize a new expo application
- npx create-expo-app --template
- npm i to install dependencies
- npx expo start to start the app
- npx expo --tunnel to share
